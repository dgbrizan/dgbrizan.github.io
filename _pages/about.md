I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/) at the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/) and I am co-director of the [MAGICS Research Lab](https://magics.github.io/).

Teaching
======
I am on sabbatical in the 2024-2025 academic year. Normally, I teach courses in:
* Machine Learning (CS 463 / CS 663)
* Algorithms and Data Structures (CS 245)

I plan on teaching Natural Language Processing in Fall 2025.

Research
======
My research interests are in Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically what language can tell us about a person or her culture. Because NLP often uses data and machine learning, I publish a little in that area as well.
