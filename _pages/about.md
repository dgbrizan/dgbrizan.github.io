I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/) at the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/) and I am co-director of the [MAGICS Research Lab](https://magics.cs.usfca.edu/).

Teaching
======
I am on sabbatical in the 2024-2025 academic year. I am not teaching courses until Fall semester 2025. [Previous courses and more...](/teaching/)

Research
======
My research interests are in Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically what language can tell us about a person or her culture. Because NLP often uses data and machine learning, I publish a little in that area as well. [More...](/publications/)
